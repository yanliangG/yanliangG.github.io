{{% align %}} Referential Communication Analysis with ARIA Glasses {{% /align %}}

### Abstract
This study explores how the spatial location of objects can influence referring expressions with a focus on hand gestures. This knowledge can be valuable when designing a natural and effective system for human-computer interactions. Participants have been conducting a set of tasks while wearing ARIA glasses which is a wearable computer that gathers gestures, speech and gaze from the participants. The tasks were done in a kitchen lab and contained a set of recipes with ingredients that the participant would memorize and refer to. With data retrieved from the headset, we were able to come to a conclusion, which states that gestures are used for referring to objects and that size and visibility may affect the usage of gesture. Future work could be done with a broader group of participants, and more multimodal languages could be tested for a broader view of the usage of gesture.
