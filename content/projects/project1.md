{{% align %}} Meal Prepping Helper Prototype {{% /align %}}

### Description
The initial idea started from improving interdependence among people. Our aim was to design an interactive prototype that supported some type of collaboration between people preparing their meals, and our goal was to somehow rethink meal prepping as a collective activity rather than individual. We conducted user study to figure out users' pain points and how collaboration would make their meal prepping experiences better. We followed the steps guided by double-diamond model and designed our prototype of the application using Figma.
